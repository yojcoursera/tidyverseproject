4,"Wells Fargo Home Mortgage put me in a payment suspension program 3 months ago, even though I did not need it. I was not suffering a hardship from Covid 19. I not only haven't missed a payment during the 3-month forbearance, I've actually made 3 additional mortgage payments in that time period. On the Wells Fargo website, it is stated that I can end the payment suspension at any time. THAT IS A LIE. I have requested that the program end multiple times, and they still have not done it. In addition, because I am still in forbearance, my mortgage account statements are not accurate or transparent. The information on my statements appear to be based on a strange and questionable accounting program devised by Wells Fargo. What credible reason could Wells Fargo possibly have for their obscure accounting, as statements should be accurate at all times. I have questioned WF executives about their accounting and I've been told repeatedly that the statements will be adjusted at a later time. What kind of BS is that? I am requesting again, that I be taken out of the payment suspension program. I also expect Wells Fargo to provide me with an updated and ACCURATE mortgage statement. It doesn't say much for the credibility of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage that I have to address these issues through Consumer Financial Protection Bureau..",WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,PA,189XX,Web

9,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I received a response from Wells Fargo regarding my payment terms for a private student loan. It took my university thru mid XX/XX/XXXX to ascertain whether I was eligible for a forbearance per my MPN and loan disclosure documentation. I was denied on the basis that the maximum forbearance time had been used under my MPN. Wells Fargo has responded making a distinction between an in-school forbearance and payment deferment. It is true that there is a maximum deferment time per the terms outlined in my MPN. However, any forbearance that I have requested beyond that was not disclosed to me as a modification of the original loan terms in agreement with the loan originator, which is NOT Wells Fargo. 

In their XXXX XXXX response Wells Fargo claims that my loans entered into a "" payment deferment '' and lists several dates during which the payment was deferred. However, no such term "" payment deferment '' exists as a status per my MPN, nor has any representative referred to such a type when requesting a forbearance of any kind. in fact, the MPN outlines the common set of terms with which the loan was originated with -- this term is not listed. Each representative I've requested a forbearance with specifically stated that the reason for the forbearance was because I was "" in-school. '' At no time did any representative make me aware of a "" payment deferment, '' that was anything outside the terms specified in my MPN of an in-school forbearance with an extension of forbearance time because I am completing advanced degrees. Furthermore, when requesting an "" in-school deferment, "" each representative corrected me referring to an "" in-school forbearance. '' Wells Fargo is therefore making a distinction between what was applied under the conditions of my MPN, and an arbitrary category Wells Fargo refers to only in the attached letter as a "" payment deferment. '' In my last phone conversation with a Wells Fargo representative I was informed that I had other kinds of forbearance options to include relief during the current pandemic, and an option for a forbearance if I was participating in an internship. Wells Fargo failed to notify me of any forbearance available to me for internships. This is an issue because I was an intern at a XXXX XXXX during the summers of the XXXX and XXXX. It is the internship corresponding to the same program that I mentioned in the history section below. Thus, any forbearance time granted to me should be extended out and offset by the periods for which I was an intern. Furthermore, since payments could be deferred for reasons of an internship, and negative payment history should be removed and prevented from reporting for the duration of which I should have had the internship forbearance. 

As my payments began in XXXX of XXXX, WF is reporting adverse credit information to compel me, a student of non-traditional age, with a documented learning XXXX, from a minority background, to obtain employment during a pandemic so that they can offset the YoY Q3 interest income losses of XXXX percent. By forcing students into repayment during a pandemic they are attempting to hedge their losses due in the low-interest rate environment. Those of us who may be struggling are viewed as a number in their actuarial computations rather than as individuals. 

Wells Fargo makes no effort to acknowledge the difficulties that individuals from underrepresented backgrounds may face nor acknowledge the difficulties students with learning XXXX may face. What they care about is squeezing individuals for money, withholding forbearance information, and creating new terms to obfuscate their dubious practices. 

Documentation of my internships is attached. 

HISTORY : On XXXX XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo regarding a private student loan forbearance request. The letter was dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The letter stated that I was denied the ability to obtain an in-school forbearance request because I had exhausted the maximum amount of in-school forbearance. I was baffled because a Forbearance request had been approved XXXX XXXX of XXXX, and I simply was asking for an additional Forbearance term to finish the last of outstanding work related to my academic education that was slowed on account of contracting the XXXX virus in Late XXXX XXXX of XXXX, and the disruption that all students have faced due to the XXXX pandemic. Now, Wells Fargo extends Forbearance beyond the maximum time, my request thru XX/XX/XXXX was such a case ( See Complaint Number XXXX ) These requests are manually evaluated by their underwriting division. I contacted Wells Fargo and inquired about the denial. The representative reviewed the notes and read them to me. The notes specifically stated that the denial was because "" I had reached the maximum forbearance period, had been in-school for twelve ( 12 ) years working towards a degree, for which six ( 6 ) of those years was to obtain a XXXX XXXX. '' I was shocked, and offended because no one had contacted me from Wells Fargo for additional information. To be clear, I hold a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX that was conferred in XXXX. I hold a Masters of XXXX. The two ( 2 ) final degrees that WF approved thru XX/XX/XXXX were for an additional dual-degree research-based XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX a representative from Wells Fargo named XXXX explained that from an evaluation standpoint a single XXXX XXXX is not evaluated any differently than pursuit of dual masters degrees. XXXX further explained that the evaluation would be different if I was pursuing receiving a PhD. The maximum in-school Forbearance time for private student loans originating with Wells Fargo for masters degrees is around one-thousand ( 1000 ) days. No subsequent time is allotted for additional masters degrees. Thus, a student that may have a learning XXXX, but who may pursue additional advanced degrees is treated differently than a student obtaining n-number of masters degrees because a student without a XXXX would spend "" less '' time pursuing a single XXXX XXXX and be able to defer student loans during the pursuit of additional masters degrees within the same time-frame it would take a student with a learning XXXX to finish a single XXXX XXXX. Therefore, Wells Fargo gives preferential treatment to those students who are deemed to have normal brain chemistry and normal brain structure. In my case, the duration of my total academic education is reflective of the struggle I've faced as an individual with a documented learning XXXX that is on-file with the academic institutions I've attended. Not only does Wells Fargo fail acknowledge the extended time a "" XXXX '' student XXXX need to complete a single advanced degree, but additionally fails to understand the discrimination that individuals with XXXX face when pursing their advanced degrees. For instance, I have been on the receiving end of discrimination by faculty and staff members at the institutions I've attended because the request for reasonable accommodations was viewed as "" inconvenient '' for certain instructors to implement, despite the protections I am entitled to under the respective University policies and under Federal law as a member of a protected class. for students with documented XXXX, but fails to understand that those with learning XXXX are subject to discrimination when completing their academic programs. The fact that I am also a minority based upon my ethnic background only magnifies the discrimination. Now, Wells Fargo has assumed that an individual will make more money by pursuing a PhD rather than two ( 2 ) or more masters degrees. Furthermore, I hold the title of XXXX XXXX when working in industry, and have an earning potential well into six ( 6 ) figures based upon my last salary. In fact, the average salary for a tenured track engineering professor with a PhD is around XXXX XXXX dollars. To put it in perspective my annual base salary with my last employer was XXXX XXXX dollars before quarterly and annual bonuses, stock options, and XXXX matching. By the time stock options, quarterly bonuses, annual bonuses, and individuals bonuses are taken into consideration, my last gross income was nearly XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX above an engineering professor on a tenure track with a PhD. On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo sent me an electronic message, that in summary was a form letter that insisted I have forbearance options under a declared disaster, but that in contrast to the in-school forbearance any derogatory covering the beginning of the forbearance period would not be backdated to include the time to process the forbearance. This is in stark contrast to an in-school which removes any adverse payment history furnished to the CRAs for backdated to the month the advanced academic program begins. Furthermore, the disaster forbearance XXXX only be applied for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX three-month periods for each declared disaster, for a maximum of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX months of forbearance due to a disaster. Therefore it is in Wells Fargos best interest to deny my request for an in-school forbearance if they believe they can coerce/force, me into repayment within a smaller amount of time, even if it places me at significant health risk. Finally, I am an individual that made a living in defense and aerospace prior to returning to academic for full-time graduate study. Additionally I am an individual that holds, or has held, a security clearance. That is a life-binding obligation and my finances will be monitored by the Federal Government for the rest of my life. Security clearances are renewed, and modified, on an as-needed basis as determined by my employer and the Federal government. Certain positions require that my outstanding obligations be reported no more than ninety ( 90 ) days past-due. Right now, due to the turn-around time for the initial in-school forbearance evaluation my student loans with Wells Fargo are eighty-six ( 86 ) days past-due. Loss of my security clearances would make it highly likely that I would be unable to obtain a position within the fields I am currently pursuing the dual masters degrees in. Wells Fargo, is attempting to do is to compel me to leave my current academic program, obtain suitable employment, and make payments on loans that they hold. That is, XXXX is attempting to compel me to find employment of some kind during a pandemic. To be clear, the dual degree was under a fellowship and I am thus contractually required to finish it. Wells Fargo has provided no offer, nor mentioned, temporary relief due to the XXXX pandemic when XXXX XXXX has instructed private lenders to offer relief to borrowers. As my payments began in XXXX of XXXX, WF is reporting adverse credit information to compel me, a student of non-traditional age, with a documented learning XXXX, from a minority background, to obtain employment during a pandemic. Again, no temporary hardship relief has been offered, and the forbearance request under in-school deferment was denied. Intentionally or unintentionally, Wells Fargo is discriminating against me as a minority with a "" learning XXXX, '' at a time when a significant portion of all United States persons are experiencing hardship due to sickness and loss of employment. It makes no sense to abandon an education that I am contractually required to finish to seek employment to pay WF. Likewise, it makes no sense for me to try and seek employment during a pandemic, especially when my line of work and/or formal education would make it likely that I would have to relocate to states currently marked as pandemic hot spots. I do not expect to be treated like this -- at all. I find it appalling that Wells Fargo would resort to such methods to maintain steady increases in shareholder equity, and to maximize profits in a low interest rate market.",WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MI,481XX,Web

11,"My student loan is currently in deferment. I would like to end the deferment and be placed on an "" extended graduated '' payment plan. I work full-time for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a week and have sufficient stable income. The student loan servicer told me that they can not put me on a payment plan because I am currently in school ( I take classes online during nighttime for a XXXX XXXX XXXX  ). They told me I can make payments at any time, but they can not put me on a payment plan. This situation is causing financial hardship for me because I am unable to refinance my mortgage because XXXX assume that my payments would be 1-2 % of the outstanding balance, which would be at least $ XXXX  monthly. If I could get on the extended graduated payment plan then my payments would be only {$330.00} / month and my mortgage refinance would save me over {$600.00} per month. I also would qualify for student loan forgiveness after I make 120 "" scheduled '' payments. Payments that I make during deferral do not count, so I am losing money on this as well. All I want is to get on a payment plan and have monthly payments scheduled from my servicer. The servicer said it would be illegal for them to put me on a repayment plan while I am in school ( even though I request it ).

17,"On XX/XX/2020, I contacted Freedom Mortgage to inquire about a possible refinance of my loan.I spoke with XXXX XXXX. In our conversation, we discussed my eligibility for a lower interest rate and pre-approval.I tentatively agreed to the terms provided over the phone by Mr. XXXX and inquired about the possibility of deferring 2 mortgage payments during the refinance process to assist with some expenses of the recent loss of a family member.Mr. XXXX advised that I could in fact defer those 2 payments if I got all the electronic documentation signed and returned in a timely manner.He stated that if all documents were returned timely that I could skip XXXX and XXXX mortgage payments and that I would be responsible for the refinanced XXXX payment to the new loan. 

That evening, I received the beginning documentation for the refinance process. I reviewed the documents, signed them electronically, and returned them as instructed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a form email that stated that Freedom Mortgage had all documents that were needed and If there were any changes I would be informed right away. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received 2 emails that had loan documentation that needed electronic signatures. One email was for my signature and the other was for my wifes signature.Upon review of the documentation requesting my wife signature, it was noted that my wifes first name was misspelled.I made a call to Mr. XXXX regarding this matter and left a detailed message on his voicemail as he was not available at the time. 

A week elapsed and on XX/XX/XXXX, just when I planned to call again to check on the status of my refinance I was contacted via email by XXXX XXXX. She requested identification for my spouse to ensure accuracy of the documents and informed my that the next step was to get scheduled for closing. I sent her a scanned copy of my wifes drivers license as she requested. 

On XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX I was contacted via email by Ms. XXXX. These were updates on status of my refinance.They basically stated that the title company was reviewing the documents and spelling change and that she would call to schedule closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote an email to Ms. XXXX to get an update. No response was received from her until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX at Freedom Mortgage. It was after general business hours and I was just trying to get an update on my refinance status. XXXX informed me that everything looked like it was progressing but timelines were trending a bit longer due to COVID-19. I was understanding and thanked her for the information. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email response from Ms. XXXX. In that email, it was stated that, The title company is currently preparing the deed. I do apologize for the time frame. My manager has escalated the problem. And we are looking for all documents to be completed by the end of the week. I will follow up with you tomorrow. Thank you This was the last communication I received from Freedom Mortgage regarding my pending refinance.

Now, I lack the credit protections that forbearance provides as I try to navigate this complex and troubling situation. 

The act of placing my loan in a forbearance without my knowledge has put me in a difficult and desperate financial situation as I now no longer qualify for refinance.

20,"XXXX XXXX per the instructions of select portfolio servicing, the title company withheld {$250000.00} from the proceeds from the sale of my house. This money was wired to select portfolio serving for a loan with {$0.00} balance and {$35000.00} in the escrow account. At my insistence the money I DID NOT OWE was returned to the title company XX/XX/2020 - without releasing the lien. The title company resent the {$250000.00} as reflected in the pay off statement. XX/XX/2020 select portfolio again returned the money to alpha title the company that closed the buyers of my house. At this time I have no idea where the money is from my proceeds of the Sale of my house. I believe this lien is for a line of credit to which I never agreed, received no value nor have any access to use. WHERE IS THE {$250000.00} NO ONE GAVE ME? This money was literally STOLEN from my proceeds by select portfolio servicing.","SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.",MO,641XX,Web
